# The τετραφάρμακος-relapse project

# about

The tetrapharmakos has been a fist launched in 2012 for the CNES cansat competition and then in Octave's Eve4 rocket. After a couple of years of break, it is time to reload the project !

# Missions

There are two missions. The first (and simple) one, is to measure some meteorological parameters (temperature, hygrometry). The second one is to take photos of the ground through an infrared and a red filter to get the NDVI of the landscape.

# Radiocommunication and position tracking

A position tracking with GPS would be helpful not to lose the cansat. All data will be transmitted to a ground station through an RF connection.
